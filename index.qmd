I am an applied microeconomist looking to apply my quantitative skills to solve real-world issues. I have a PhD in applied economics, and my research to this point has focused on optimal management of natural resources. I am currently seeking my next role, and I am excited to see how I can use data to answer pressing questions in either academic research or in an industry role. I am experienced in modeling complex systems, establishing causality through applied econometrics, and obtaining and cleaning data to answer important questions.
