    "text": "Policies to promote wildlife conservation in a spatially heterogeneous landscape\n(with Daniela Miteva and Sathya Gopalakrishnan)\nAbstract:\n\nEffective payments for conservation are an important tool to provide transfers from those who derive utility from wildlife involved in human-wildlife conflict and those who bear the economic costs, in order to reduce poaching and promote coexistence. We consider the cost effectiveness of payment schemes across two management goals: poaching reduction and farmer welfare compensation. We build upon previous models to consider how these payments should be applied over space when farmers face heterogeneous depredation risk and thus heterogeneous incentives to poach wildlife. We compare commonly used uniform compensation to spatially targeted compensation, finding that poaching can be reduced further by targeted payments given a limited government agency budget. Regarding the management goal of transfers to livestock owners to promote tolerance, we find that ``payments for presence’’ may be preferred in some settings to increase farmer welfare without distorting stocking decisions. Our work suggests that wildlife managers should consider the use of each of these types of payments, dependent on key parameters in each particular setting, and that careful analysis of a particular setting is important before the implementation of a program.\n\nLink to PDF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Role of Forests in Reducing the Incidence of Acute Respiratory Infections: Evidence from India\n(with Daniela Miteva and Sathya Gopalakrishnan)\nLink to PDF\n\n\nStorage as a determinant of market participation:Evidence from northern Ghana\n(with Daniela Miteva)\nLink to PDF"

I have a PhD in applied economics, and my research to this point has focused on optimal management of natural resources. I am currently seeking my next role, and I am excited to see how I can use data to answer pressing questions in either academic research or in an industry role. I am experienced in modeling complex systems, establishing causality with through applied econometrics, and obtaining and cleaning data to answer important questions."
