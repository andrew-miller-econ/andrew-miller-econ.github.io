I am an applied microeconomist looking to apply my quantitative skills to solve real-world issues. I have a PhD in applied economics, and am excited to see how I can use data to answer your pressing questions, regardless of domain. I am experienced in modeling complex systems, establishing causality with through applied econometrics, and obtaining and cleaning data to answer important questions.
